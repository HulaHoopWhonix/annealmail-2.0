  <h3>How to Resolve Problems with Initializing AnnealMail</h3>

  <p>There are several reasons why initializing AnnealMail does not succeed. The most common ones are described below;
     for more information please visit the <a href="https://github.com/mapmeld/annealmail/issues" target="_blank">AnnealMail's GitHub Issues page.</a></p>

  <dl>
    <dt>GnuPG could not be found</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      In order for AnnealMail to work, the tool <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/" target="_blank">GnuPG</a> needs to be installed.
      If GnuPG cannot be found, then first make sure that the executable <tt>ccr.exe</tt> (on Windows; <tt>ccr</tt> on other platforms) is installed on your computer.
      If GnuPG is installed, and AnnealMail cannot find it, then you need to manually set the path to GnuPG in the AnnealMail Preferences (menu <i>AnnealMail</i> &gt; <i>Preferences</i>)

      <p>
      AnnealMail works only if it is built using the same build environment as Thunderbird or SeaMonkey was built. This means that you can use the official AnnealMail releases only if you use the official releases of Thunderbird or SeaMonkey provided by <a href="www.mozilla.org">mozilla.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you use a Thunderbird or SeaMonkey version coming from some other source (e.g. the provider of your Linux distribution), or if you built the application yourself, you should either use an AnnealMail version built by the same source, or build AnnealMail yourself. For building AnnealMail, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/mapmeld/annealmail">GitHub repo</a>. Please don't file any bug report concerning this problem, it is not solvable.
